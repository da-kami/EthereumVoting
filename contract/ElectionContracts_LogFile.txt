v1: 0xf4a5c34e529f3d9eb677aaacad16c0bdd22319e6

v2: 0xd3ff636593ae30f1ca0abae133e071f35aebaa7d
Includes way more getters for testing

v3: 0x90f40a42f182e89e84d7a1b0d4076efd1801df84
fixed but: admin was not set in constructor...

v4: 0xa0b6f84330f7ae4bf753c21f6304d3d376be76a4
removed the check at the voting function that checks if the party was registered. not really needed, and most likely bugy.

v5: 0xcd32a6d1c84fbf98c5bcd94e64e58421493028eb
removed the setElection(...) part - the reset did not work correctly.
Now the setup is like this: one contract for exactly one election

v6: 0x42d4d2CBAD8cC7421e4f332bD0EfA3A111cCa349 
fixed problem. The votes were not summed up correctly.
